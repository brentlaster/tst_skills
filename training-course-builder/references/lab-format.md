# Lab Format Specification

This document defines the exact format for labs.md files in TechUpSkills training courses.
Follow these conventions precisely when creating or updating labs.

## Document Header

```markdown
# [Course Full Name]
## [Day/Session] - [Topic Description]
## Session labs
## Revision [X.Y] - [MM/DD/YY]

**Follow the startup instructions in the README.md file IF NOT ALREADY DONE!**

**NOTE: To copy and paste in the codespace, you may need to use keyboard commands - CTRL-C and CTRL-V. Chrome may work best for this.**
```

## Lab Structure

Each lab follows this pattern:

### Lab Title
```markdown
**Lab [N] - [Descriptive Title]**

**Purpose: In this lab, we'll [learn/see/explore] [what the lab teaches].**
```

The purpose statement always starts with "In this lab, we'll" and describes what students will
learn or accomplish. Keep it to one sentence.

### Step Format

Steps are numbered sequentially starting at 1 for each lab:

```markdown
[N]. [Instruction text that tells the student what to do. Can reference files by name
using *italic* formatting or by linking them as [**dir/filename.py**](./dir/filename.py).]

\```
[command to run or code to look at]
\```
![descriptive alt text](./images/imagename.png?raw=true "tooltip text")

<br><br>
```

Key conventions:
- **Step numbering**: Sequential within each lab (1, 2, 3...), resets for each new lab
- **File references**: Use italics for inline mentions (*filename.py*) and bold links for "click to open" ([**dir/filename.py**](./dir/filename.py))
- **Directory references**: Use italics (*llm*, *rag*, *extra*)
- **Commands**: Always in fenced code blocks (triple backticks)
- **Screenshots**: Format is `![alt text](./images/name.png?raw=true "tooltip")`
- **Spacing**: `<br><br>` between each step for visual separation
- **Terminal context**: When students need to change directories, explicitly tell them with a `cd` command

### Code Blocks

- Use plain fenced code blocks (no language specifier) for commands students type
- Use language-specific fencing only when showing code to read (not execute)
- Show the exact command, not abbreviated versions

### Tables

Use markdown tables when comparing data or showing mappings:

```markdown
| **Header 1** | **Header 2** | **Header 3** |
| :---------: | :--------: | :--------------------: |
| value | value | value |
```

Center-align with `:-:` syntax. Bold the headers.

### Optional/Advanced Steps

Mark optional content clearly:

```markdown
[N]. (Optional) If you get done early and want more to do, [instruction].
```

Or for multi-step optional sections:

```markdown
**Steps [N]-[M] are optional and may take longer than lab time allows.**

<br>
```

### Discussion Points

For conceptual takeaways, use a numbered list with bold keywords:

```markdown
[N]. Discussion Points:
   - **[Concept Name]**: [Brief explanation]
   - **[Concept Name]**: [Brief explanation]
```

### Lab Ending

Every lab ends with:

```markdown
<p align="center">
**[END OF LAB]**
</p>
</br></br>
```

Note: Some labs use `<b>[END OF LAB]</b>` instead of `**[END OF LAB]**`. Either is acceptable
but be consistent within a single labs.md file.

### Key Takeaways

Between lab groups or at major transitions, include:

```markdown
**Key Takeaway:**
> [One sentence summary of the key concept]
```

## Document Footer

```markdown
<p align="center">
<b>For educational use only by the attendees of our workshops.</b>
</p>

<p align="center">
<b>(c) [YEAR] Tech Skills Transformations and Brent C. Laster. All rights reserved.</b>
</p>
```

## Image Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive, short names: `ae-[topic]-[number].png` or `arag[number].png`
- The prefix typically relates to the course (ae = AI Engineering, arag = AI RAG, etc.)
- Include the `?raw=true` parameter for GitHub rendering
- Alt text should describe what the screenshot shows
- Tooltip text should match or paraphrase the alt text

## Writing Style

- Use second person ("you will see", "enter the command")
- Be direct and concise in instructions
- Explain the "why" briefly, but focus on the "do"
- After running something, tell students what output to expect
- When output is interesting, explain what it means
- Use "Notice..." to draw attention to important observations
- Reference line numbers when pointing to specific code ("Scroll down to around line 55")

## Diff-Merge Lab Pattern

For labs where students merge completed code into a skeleton:

```markdown
[N]. [Context about what we're building]. We have a completed version and a skeleton version.
Use the diff command to see the differences:

\```
code -d ../extra/[complete_file].txt [skeleton_file].py
\```

<br><br>

[N+1]. Once you have the diff view open, take a moment to look at the structure in the complete
version on the left. Notice [key things to observe].

<br><br>

[N+2]. Now, merge the code segments from the complete file (left side) into the skeleton file
(right side) by clicking the arrow pointing right in the middle bar for each difference.
[Specific order guidance if needed].

<br><br>

[N+3]. After merging all the changes, double-check that there are no remaining diffs
(red blocks on the side). Then close the diff view by clicking the "X" in the tab.
```

**IMPORTANT ordering rule:** The correct flow is always: view skeleton → diff/merge → run.
Never ask students to run a skeleton file before its merge step. If showing the skeleton before
merging, explicitly note: "Note: this file is incomplete — we'll merge in the working code in
the next step."

## Timing Estimates

Include timing information to help instructors pace the class and help students know if something
is stuck vs. just slow.

### Per-lab timing
Add an estimated completion time to each lab's header or purpose statement:
```markdown
**Lab [N] - [Title]** (~15-20 minutes)

**Purpose: In this lab, we'll [description].**
```

### Per-step timing for slow operations
When a step involves a known slow operation, include an approximate wait time:

```markdown
[N]. Run the program. **This may take 1-2 minutes** as the local model generates its response.

\```
python rag_query.py
\```
```

### Common timing expectations
Use these as guidelines when estimating lab step durations:
- **Codespace setup**: 3-5 minutes (container build + post-create scripts)
- **Ollama model warmup**: 1-3 minutes (post-attach model pull/warm-up)
- **Local LLM queries**: 30 seconds to 2+ minutes per query (depends on model size and machine type)
- **`code -d` merge operations**: 2-5 minutes (student reading + merging)
- **Server startup**: 2-5 seconds (Flask, Uvicorn, etc.)
- **pip install steps**: 1-3 minutes depending on packages
- **Model downloads**: 2-10 minutes depending on model size

## Troubleshooting Guidance

Labs should not assume the happy path. Include troubleshooting notes for steps with common
failure modes. This prevents students from getting stuck and raising their hand for easily
solved issues.

### Inline troubleshooting pattern
After a step with a common failure mode, add a brief note:

```markdown
[N]. Run the application:

\```
python app.py
\```

> **If you see** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langchain'`: Your virtual environment
> may not be activated. Run `source py_env/bin/activate` and try again.

<br><br>
```

### Common issues to document

Include troubleshooting notes for these common problems when relevant:

- **Virtual environment not activated**: If Python commands fail with "module not found", add:
  "Run `source .venv/bin/activate` or `source py_env/bin/activate` — the prompt should show
  the venv name like `(py_env)`."
- **Ollama not running**: If model-related commands fail, add: "Check if Ollama is running with
  `ollama list`. You may need to run `ollama serve &` first."
- **Port already in use**: If a server won't start, add: "If you see 'Address already in use',
  run `kill $(lsof -t -i:PORT)` to free the port, then try again."
- **Interactive program won't exit**: Add: "Press `Ctrl+C` to exit the interactive prompt."
- **Slow LLM responses**: Add: "This may take 1-2 minutes on a 4-core Codespace — be patient."

### Troubleshooting appendix
For courses with complex environments, consider adding a troubleshooting appendix at the end of
labs.md (before the copyright footer) covering environment-wide issues.

## Benign Warnings Documentation

Students frequently see terminal warnings that look alarming but are harmless. Proactively
document these to prevent confusion and unnecessary hand-raising.

### When to add warning notes
After any step that produces known harmless warnings, add a note:

```markdown
[N]. Install the required packages:

\```
pip install -r requirements.txt
\```

> You may see warnings about pip version or package deprecation — these are harmless and won't
> affect the labs.

<br><br>
```

### Common benign warnings by course type

**AI/ML courses:**
- `[W:onnxruntime:Default, device_discovery.cc:131 GetPciBusId] Skipping pci_bus_id...` — harmless hardware detection
- Python deprecation warnings from third-party packages — don't affect functionality
- `A new version of pip is available` — informational, not an error
- TensorFlow/PyTorch CUDA warnings when running on CPU — expected in Codespace environments

**General Codespace courses:**
- Git "detached HEAD" notices — expected when Codespaces checks out a specific commit
- `npm WARN` messages during `npm install` — usually about optional dependencies
- VS Code extension installation warnings — don't affect lab functionality
