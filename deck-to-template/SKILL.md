# Deck-to-Template Converter

Converts a talk deck + speaker script to the business template style defined in `tst_template.pptx`.

## What This Skill Does

Given three inputs:
1. **Talk deck** (.pptx) — the presentation to convert
2. **Speaker script** (.md) — with `## SLIDE N` delimiters matching each slide
3. **Template deck** (`tst_template.pptx`) — the reference business template

The skill:
- Replaces the talk deck's theme, slide master, and slide layouts with the template's
- Ensures all content slides use the white curved-lines background (slideLayout5)
- Section divider slides get the template's divider style (centered bold Poppins title, teal accent bar, semi-transparent overlay)
- Prepends the template's first 3 slides: version slide (hidden, auto-updated version/date), title slide (with auto-extracted title), and "About me" slide (as-is from template)
- Appends the template's closing slide ("That's all - thanks!")
- Skips the talk deck's own version, title, and ending slides (template provides these)
- Recolors white/light text and dark-background accent colors for readability on the white template
- Scales all shape positions and sizes when slide dimensions differ (including charts and embedded objects)
- Copies charts, embedded Excel workbooks, and other linked objects
- Preserves ALL script content — including full opening and closing speech text from bookend slides
- Auto-increments the version number and sets today's date on the version slide
- Saves the deck as `_templated.pptx` and the updated script as `_templated.md`

## Prerequisites

Read the pptx SKILL.md first — this skill builds on its editing workflow and tools.

**Required**: The pptx skill must be installed at `.claude/skills/pptx/scripts/` — the conversion script uses its `unpack.py`, `pack.py` (with validation/auto-repair), and `clean.py` for reliable OOXML output.

```bash
pip install "markitdown[pptx]" Pillow --break-system-packages -q
```

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Phase 1: Locate Files and Extract Info

1. Find the three input files: the talk deck, the script, and `tst_template.pptx` (should be in the same folder or the user's workspace folder).

2. The script auto-extracts the talk title from both the script's SLIDE 2 section and the actual slide XML, combining multi-line titles at the same font size.

3. Count slides in the talk deck and SLIDE sections in the script — they must match before proceeding.

```bash
python -m markitdown <talk-deck>.pptx 2>/dev/null | grep -c "Slide number:"
grep -c '^## SLIDE' <script>.md
```

### Phase 2: Run the Conversion Script

```bash
python <skill-path>/scripts/convert_to_template.py \
  --talk-deck <path-to-talk.pptx> \
  --template-deck <path-to-tst_template.pptx> \
  --script <path-to-script.md> \
  --title "The Talk Title" \
  --subtitle "Optional subtitle line" \
  --output-dir <output-directory>
```

**Arguments:**
- `--talk-deck`: Path to the talk's .pptx file
- `--template-deck`: Path to tst_template.pptx
- `--script`: Path to the speaker script .md file
- `--title`: Talk title (auto-extracted from script/slides if not provided)
- `--subtitle`: Optional subtitle for the title slide
- `--output-dir`: Where to save outputs (defaults to same folder as talk deck)

**Outputs:**
- `<original-name>_templated.pptx` — the converted deck
- `<original-name>_templated.md` — the updated script

### Phase 3: Verify the Conversion

**This is critical — always verify after conversion.**

#### 3a. Content verification

```bash
python -m markitdown <output>.pptx 2>/dev/null
```

Check:
- First 3 slides are version (with updated version/date), title (with correct talk title), about-me
- Last slide is the closing slide
- All original talk slides are present in the correct order between front and end
- Section divider text is preserved
- No content was lost or garbled
- Charts and embedded objects are present and correctly sized

#### 3b. Slide count verification

```bash
# Count output slides
python -m markitdown <output>.pptx 2>/dev/null | grep -c "Slide number:"

# Count script sections
grep -c '^## SLIDE' <output-script>.md

# They must be equal
```

The output deck should have: talk content slides + 3 front bookends + 1 end bookend.
The output script should have the same number of SLIDE sections.

#### 3c. Script content verification

```bash
# Check that SLIDE 2 (TITLE) has the full opening speech, not just a stub
head -40 <output-script>.md
```

Verify that the original speech content from the talk script's title/opening section is preserved in SLIDE 2, and the closing remarks are preserved in the ending slide section.

#### 3d. Visual verification (if soffice available)

```bash
python <pptx-skill-path>/scripts/office/soffice.py --headless --convert-to pdf <output>.pptx
pdftoppm -jpeg -r 150 <output>.pdf slide
```

Inspect key slides:
- Slide 1: Version slide (hidden, shows updated version + today's date)
- Slide 2: Title slide with correct talk title
- Slide 3: About me slide
- Slide 4+: Content slides with white curved lines background, readable dark text
- Section dividers: Bold centered text with teal accent bar
- Slides with charts/graphics: correctly sized, not tiny or overflowing
- Last slide: "That's all - thanks!" closing

### Phase 4: Verify Script Sync

Read the output script and confirm:
- SLIDE 1 (VERSION): `[Skip]`
- SLIDE 2 (TITLE): **Full original opening speech preserved** — NOT a stub
- SLIDE 3 (ABOUT ME): Brief placeholder
- Middle sections: All original SLIDE sections in order with content intact
- Last SLIDE (ENDING): **Full original closing speech preserved** — NOT a stub
- Total SLIDE count matches total slide count in the deck

## What the Conversion Script Does Internally

The script handles complex OOXML-level work:

### Theme & Layout Replacement
- Unpacks both decks using the pptx skill's `unpack.py`
- Copies the template's theme, slide master, and ALL slide layouts into the output
- Every content slide is remapped to use slideLayout5 (white curved-lines background)
- The curved-lines background is a `blipFill` with `image1.png` on the layout, NOT a solid fill on the master

### Background Stripping
- Strips explicit `<p:bg>` elements from ALL imported talk slides
- Original slides typically have hardcoded solid color fills (F5F5F5, FFFFFF, 011936, etc.) that would override the layout background inheritance
- Without stripping, slides appear with their original solid backgrounds instead of the curved-lines

### Text Recoloring
- Slides designed for dark themes have white (FFFFFF) or light scheme-colored text (bg1, lt1, lt2, bg2) invisible on white
- The script changes these to dark (#333333) for readability
- **Also remaps accent colors that don't work on white backgrounds**: teal #00A79D (designed for dark slides) is remapped to dark blue #003366
- Handles both explicit `a:srgbClr` and scheme colors in `a:rPr` (run properties) and `a:defRPr` (default paragraph run properties)

### Dimension Scaling
- Detects slide size mismatch between talk deck and template (e.g., 10"×5.63" → 13.33"×7.5")
- Scales ALL shape positions and sizes by the ratio (typically 4/3 for this template)
- Handles BOTH `a:xfrm` (regular shapes) AND `p:xfrm` (graphicFrames like charts) — **this is critical**: charts use `p:xfrm`, and failing to scale them leaves chart graphics tiny
- Also scales group shape child offsets/extents (`a:chOff`, `a:chExt`)

### Overflow Clamping (Uniform Compression)
- After scaling, some slides may have shapes extending beyond the slide boundary
- Uses a **uniform compression strategy**: finds the maximum overflow across ALL shapes, then compresses all positions and sizes proportionally
- This preserves relative spacing instead of just squishing the rightmost shapes
- Applies a 150,000 EMU (~0.16") safe margin from edges to prevent shadow/antialiasing overflow

### Chart and Embedded Object Copying
- Detects chart relationships in slide rels (both relative `../charts/chart1.xml` and absolute `/ppt/charts/chart1.xml` paths)
- Copies chart XML files, chart relationship files, and embedded Excel workbooks
- Normalizes absolute chart paths to relative paths in the output rels
- Adds Content_Type overrides for all copied chart and embedding files

### Section Divider Detection & Restyling
- Identifies section dividers by: script header containing "section divider"/"divider", or slides with 1-8 words of non-numeric text
- Replaces divider content with the template's format: centered bold Poppins title (45pt, #003366), teal accent bar (#00A79D), semi-transparent overlay

### Version Slide Update
- Auto-increments the minor version number (e.g., 2.7 → 2.8)
- Sets the date to today's date in MM/DD/YY format
- Uses regex to find "Version X.Y" and date patterns in text runs

### Script Update (Content Preservation)
- Replaces front bookend sections with template versions BUT preserves the original speech content
- The body text from the talk's SLIDE 2 (opening speech) is preserved in the output's SLIDE 2 (TITLE)
- The body text from the talk's last slide (closing remarks) is preserved in the output's ending slide
- This is critical — these sections often contain substantial memorized speech content that must not be lost
- Renumbers all sections to match the new slide order
- Removes sections for skipped duplicate slides

### Duplicate Slide Detection
- Compares text content of consecutive slides
- Slides with identical text to their predecessor are flagged and skipped during conversion

### Cleanup & Validation
- Removes orphaned media files, notes slides, and rels from the template that aren't used
- Cleans stale Content_Types defaults for extensions (like .svg, .mp4) with no matching files
- Fixes notes slide back-references to point to correct slide numbers
- Packs with validation via the pptx skill's `pack.py` (catches broken references before the user sees them)

## Known OOXML Pitfalls (Lessons Learned)

These are hard-won lessons from iterative testing. Keep them in mind if modifying the script:

1. **minidom `id` attribute bug**: Using `setAttribute('id', ...)` on programmatically-created elements causes the value to be silently dropped during `toxml()`. The script uses string manipulation for `p:sldId` elements instead.

2. **Chart paths can be absolute**: Slide rels may use `/ppt/charts/chart1.xml` (absolute) instead of `../charts/chart1.xml` (relative). Must check for both when copying charts.

3. **Content_Types completeness**: Every file in the ZIP (charts, embeddings, slides, notes) must have a matching Override or Default entry in `[Content_Types].xml`. Missing entries cause PowerPoint to prompt for "repair" and silently delete content.

4. **Background inheritance hierarchy**: A slide's background comes from: (1) explicit `<p:bg>` on the slide itself, (2) the slide layout's background, (3) the slide master's background. If the slide has an explicit `<p:bg>`, it blocks layout inheritance entirely. Must strip it for the layout background to show through.

5. **`p:xfrm` vs `a:xfrm`**: Regular shapes use `a:xfrm` for positioning, but graphicFrames (charts, tables, SmartArt) use `p:xfrm`. Scaling/clamping code must handle BOTH or charts/tables will be the wrong size.

6. **Uniform compression for overflow**: Per-shape clamping (just shrinking overflowing shapes) produces ugly results where some shapes are squished while others are normal. Uniform compression of ALL shapes preserves proportional relationships.

7. **Scheme colors resolve differently per theme**: `bg1`, `lt1`, `bg2`, `lt2` resolve to white/light in most themes but dark in dark themes. When switching themes, these must be replaced with explicit colors.

8. **Accent colors from dark themes**: Colors like teal #00A79D work as readable accents on dark backgrounds but look washed-out or oddly colored on white. They need to be remapped to colors that work on the new background.

9. **Work directory permissions**: When the output directory is on a mounted/shared filesystem, `shutil.rmtree` may fail with permission errors. Use `tempfile.gettempdir()` for intermediate work directories.

10. **Script content preservation**: Bookend slides (title/opening, closing) often contain substantial speech content. The script updater must preserve the BODY text from these sections, not replace them with stubs.

## Handling Edge Cases

- **Missing tst_template.pptx**: Ask the user where their template deck is located
- **Slide/script count mismatch**: Warn the user and ask them to verify before proceeding
- **No section dividers detected**: That's fine — all slides get the standard content layout
- **Charts and embedded objects**: Automatically copied with their Excel data and relationship files
- **Media files**: All images, videos, and other media from both decks are merged (with conflict resolution for same-named files)
- **Different slide dimensions**: Automatically detected and scaled (common: 10"×5.63" talk → 13.33"×7.5" template)
- **PowerPoint repair prompt on open**: Usually caused by missing Content_Types entries — check that all files in the ZIP have matching entries

## Template Structure Reference

The `tst_template.pptx` uses these slides:
- **Slide 1**: Version slide (hidden with `show="0"`) — contains version number and date
- **Slide 2**: Title slide — uses slideLayout1 with branded imagery
- **Slide 3**: "About me" slide — uses slideLayout11 with embedded profile images
- **Slides 4-31**: Various content slides (not used by this converter)
- **Slide 32**: Closing slide — "That's all - thanks!" with contact info

Slide dimensions: 12,192,000 × 6,858,000 EMU (13.33" × 7.5" / widescreen 16:9)

The slide master's background is solid gray (bg2/E7E6E6) — this is NOT what content slides should show. Content slides must use **slideLayout5** which has the white curved-lines background image (`image1.png` via `blipFill`).
